# Perform Integration Change Control Process

**Project:** Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) - Business Strategic Plan

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**1. Purpose**

This document outlines the process for managing and controlling changes impacting the integration of various components within the SCEV project, ensuring alignment with the overall strategic plan and minimizing project risks.  The process emphasizes the unique integration challenges of a self-charging electric vehicle, particularly the interplay between energy harvesting, power management, and vehicle performance.

**2. Scope**

This process applies to all changes affecting the integration of the SCEV's subsystems, including but not limited to:

* **Energy Harvesting System:**  Photovoltaic cells, regenerative braking system, kinetic energy harvesters (if applicable).  Changes impacting efficiency, power output, durability, and integration with the vehicle's electrical system.
* **Power Management System:** Battery management system (BMS), power electronics, energy storage solutions. Changes affecting charging rates, energy distribution, efficiency, and safety.
* **Vehicle Systems Integration:**  Integration of the energy harvesting and power management systems with the vehicle's chassis, drivetrain, onboard computer, and user interface. Changes affecting vehicle performance, weight distribution, safety, and reliability.
* **Software Integration:** Integration of software controlling the energy harvesting, power management, and vehicle systems. Changes impacting functionality, user experience, and data communication.


**3. Process**

**3.1 Change Request Submission:**

All change requests must be submitted using the standardized Change Request Form (Appendix A).  The form requires a clear description of the proposed change, its impact on the project schedule, budget, and scope, and a justification for the change.  Requests should also specify the affected subsystem(s) and the potential risks and benefits of implementation.  Specific attention should be paid to the potential impact on vehicle performance (e.g., weight, efficiency, handling) and the interaction between different subsystems.

**3.2 Change Request Evaluation:**

The Change Control Board (CCB), composed of representatives from R&D, Engineering, Operations, Finance, and Marketing, will review all change requests. The CCB will assess:

* **Technical Feasibility:**  Can the change be implemented without compromising the vehicle's safety, performance, or reliability?  This includes rigorous analysis of interactions between subsystems.
* **Financial Impact:** What is the cost of implementing the change, including R&D, manufacturing, and testing?
* **Schedule Impact:** Will the change delay the project timeline?
* **Risk Assessment:** What are the potential risks associated with implementing the change, and how can they be mitigated?  This includes considering both technical and market risks.
* **Alignment with Strategic Goals:** Does the change align with the company's overall vision, mission, and core values (Innovation, Sustainability, Safety, Integrity, Customer Centricity, Quality, Collaboration, Adaptability, Respect, Leadership)?

**3.3 Change Approval/Rejection:**

The CCB will approve or reject the change request based on the evaluation.  Approved changes will receive a unique Change Request ID and be documented in the Change Register (Appendix B). Rejected changes will include a detailed explanation of the reasons for rejection.

**3.4 Change Implementation:**

Approved changes will be implemented according to a detailed implementation plan developed by the responsible team. The plan should include:

* **Task Breakdown:**  A clear breakdown of the tasks required to implement the change.
* **Resource Allocation:**  Identification of the resources (personnel, equipment, budget) required.
* **Timeline:**  A realistic timeline for completing the implementation.
* **Testing and Validation:**  A comprehensive testing plan to verify the successful integration of the change and ensure it meets all requirements.  This must include rigorous testing of the integrated systems.
* **Risk Mitigation Plan:**  Strategies for addressing any potential risks identified during the implementation.

**3.5 Change Verification and Closure:**

Once the change is implemented, it will be verified by the CCB to ensure that it meets the requirements and has not introduced any unintended consequences.  The change will then be formally closed and documented in the Change Register.

**4.  Metrics and Reporting**

The following metrics will be tracked and reported regularly:

* Number of change requests submitted and approved/rejected.
* Average time taken to evaluate and approve/reject change requests.
* Cost of implemented changes.
* Impact of changes on project schedule and budget.
* Number of defects introduced as a result of changes.

Regular reports will be provided to the project management team and stakeholders, highlighting any significant changes and their impact on the project.

**5.  Unique Considerations for SCEV Integration**

The integration of the SCEV's self-charging system presents unique challenges requiring specific attention:

* **Energy Harvesting Optimization:** Changes must be carefully assessed for their impact on energy harvesting efficiency across varying driving conditions.  Simulation and modeling are crucial to predict performance.
* **Power Management Efficiency:**  Changes must ensure optimal energy utilization, minimizing energy loss and maximizing battery life.
* **Vehicle Performance Impacts:**  The weight and size of added components must be carefully considered to avoid negatively impacting vehicle performance, handling, and fuel efficiency (though in this case, fuel efficiency is less of a concern).
* **System Interdependencies:**  Changes to one subsystem may have cascading effects on other integrated systems.  Thorough impact analysis is critical.

* Appendix B: Change Register


This process ensures that changes are managed effectively, minimizing disruptions and ensuring the successful integration of the SCEV's innovative self-charging technology while adhering to the company's core values and strategic goals.
