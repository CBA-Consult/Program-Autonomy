## Fact Sheet 1: Wind Energy Basics

### What is Wind Energy?

Wind energy is electricity generated by harnessing the natural power of wind through wind turbines. These modern machines convert the kinetic energy of moving air into clean, renewable electricity that can power homes, businesses, and communities.

### How Wind Turbines Work

1. **Wind Capture**: Large rotor blades capture wind energy and begin rotating
2. **Speed Increase**: A gearbox increases the rotation speed from about 50 rpm to approximately 1,500 rpm
3. **Electricity Generation**: A generator converts the mechanical rotation into electrical energy
4. **Power Conditioning**: A transformer converts the electricity to the proper voltage for transmission
5. **Grid Connection**: Electricity is transmitted through power lines to homes and businesses

### Key Wind Energy Facts

- **Renewable Resource**: Wind is inexhaustible and naturally replenished
- **Zero Fuel Costs**: No ongoing fuel expenses once turbines are installed
- **Scalable Technology**: From small residential turbines to large utility-scale wind farms
