## 7. Frequently Asked Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: How much electricity can a wind turbine generate?**
A: A modern utility-scale wind turbine can generate 1.5-3 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 500-1,500 average homes. Generation depends on wind speed, turbine size, and local wind resources.

**Q: How long do wind turbines last?**
A: Modern wind turbines are designed for 20-25 years of operation. With proper maintenance, many turbines can operate effectively beyond their design life.

**Q: What happens when the wind doesn't blow?**
A: Wind energy is part of a diverse electricity grid that includes multiple generation sources. Advanced forecasting helps predict wind patterns, and energy storage systems can store excess wind energy for use when winds are calm.

### Environmental Questions

**Q: Do wind turbines kill birds?**
A: While wind turbines do cause some bird fatalities, studies show they cause far fewer than buildings, vehicles, or fossil fuel operations. Modern turbines use advanced technology like radar and cameras to minimize wildlife impact.

**Q: Are wind turbines recyclable?**
A: Most wind turbine components are recyclable, including steel towers and copper wiring. The industry is developing new technologies to recycle turbine blades, which are currently the most challenging component to recycle.

**Q: Do wind farms affect local weather?**
A: Large wind farms can have minor local effects on temperature and humidity, but these effects are generally small and localized. Wind farms do not affect regional or global weather patterns.

### Economic Questions

**Q: How much do wind turbines cost?**
A: Utility-scale wind turbines cost $1-2 million per megawatt of capacity. However, wind energy has no fuel costs and minimal operating expenses, making it cost-competitive with fossil fuels.

**Q: Do wind farms affect property values?**
A: Most studies show minimal impact on property values, with effects diminishing rapidly with distance from turbines. Local economic benefits often offset any potential property value concerns.

**Q: Who pays for wind energy development?**
A: Wind energy projects are typically funded by private developers and investors. Communities benefit through tax revenue, lease payments, and job creation without public investment.

### Community Questions

**Q: How loud are wind turbines?**
A: Modern wind turbines operate at 35-45 decibels at typical distances from homes, which is quieter than a refrigerator. Noise levels are regulated by local ordinances and setback requirements.

**Q: Can I still farm around wind turbines?**
A: Yes, farming and ranching can continue around wind turbines. Turbines typically occupy less than 1% of a wind farm's land area, allowing continued agricultural use of 99% of the land.

**Q: How are wind farm locations chosen?**
A: Wind farm locations are selected based on wind resources, environmental considerations, community input, and grid access. Extensive studies are conducted to minimize environmental and community impacts.
