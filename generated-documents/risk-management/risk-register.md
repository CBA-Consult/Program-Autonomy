## 3. Risk Category Analysis (Summary)

**Technical Risks:**  Focus on the reliability and efficiency of the self-charging system, integration with existing vehicle components, and potential software bugs.  Mitigation strategies involve robust testing, contingency planning, and investment in advanced technologies.

**Operational Risks:** Center on resource availability (skilled labor, materials), supply chain disruptions, and meeting production targets. Mitigation includes proactive supply chain management, talent acquisition strategies, and contingency plans for delays.

**External Risks:**  Primarily involve regulatory hurdles, market acceptance of the novel technology, and competition.  Mitigation emphasizes proactive regulatory engagement, robust marketing, and competitive analysis.

**Financial Risks:**  Center on securing funding, managing material costs, and achieving a positive ROI. Mitigation involves diverse funding sources, supplier negotiations, and careful financial planning.

**Organizational Risks:**  Relatively low in this plan, but potential for internal communication issues and talent retention challenges are noted.  Mitigation emphasizes strong communication channels and a positive work environment.
