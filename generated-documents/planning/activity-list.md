# Activity List: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Business Strategic Plan

## Document Overview

This Activity List details the tasks required to complete the Business Strategic Plan for a Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV).  It supports the project objectives by decomposing work packages into specific, measurable, assignable, and time-estimated activities.  This list is not directly tied to a formal Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) but can be easily integrated into one if needed.  Activities are identified using a combination of the project context and best practices for project planning.
