# Work Breakdown Structure

## Document Overview
- **Project:**  Business Strategic Plan for a Self Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

- **Project Type:** Business Strategy & Technology Development

- **WBS Purpose:** Hierarchical decomposition of project scope to create a Business Strategic Plan for a Self-Charging Electric Vehicle, including technology development and market entry strategy.

- **Decomposition Approach:** Hybrid (Deliverable-based and Phase-based)

- **WBS Dictionary Reference:**  A separate document (not included here) will detail each work package with specific tasks, timelines, resource allocation, and acceptance criteria.


## WBS Development Methodology
- **100% Rule:**  Adhered to.  All aspects of the business strategic plan are included.

- **Mutually Exclusive:** Work packages are designed to be independent and avoid overlap.

- **Outcome-Oriented:**  Focus is on deliverables and measurable outcomes.

- **Decomposition Criteria:** Work packages are estimated to require between 8 and 80 hours of effort, though some Level 2 deliverables may exceed this (these will be further broken down in the WBS Dictionary).

- **Responsibility Assignment:** Each work package will be assigned a single owner (identified in the WBS Dictionary).
