# Program Project Charter

## Purpose
This charter establishes the foundation for the Self Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) program, focused on designing, developing, and delivering electric vehicles that autonomously charge using solar and renewable energy, advanced battery management, and AI optimization. The program aims to enable vehicles that arrive home fully charged and can interact bidirectionally with the grid, supporting energy autonomy and sustainability.

## Objectives
### Program Objectives
- Empower the future of mobility with SCEVs that ensure a fully charged arrival, combining cutting-edge technology and sustainable practices.
- Develop and integrate photovoltaic cells, regenerative braking, and smart energy management systems.
- Advance energy autonomy and bidirectional grid interaction (sell excess energy back to the grid).
- Deliver safe, efficient, and sustainable vehicles that exceed industry safety and quality standards.
- Foster innovation, customer centricity, and environmental stewardship throughout the product lifecycle.
- Achieve market awareness and prototyping milestones by 2030.

## Scope
### Program Scope
- Design and prototype SCEVs with integrated solar panels, advanced BMS, and AI-driven optimization.
- Develop user-friendly, connected interfaces for seamless driver experience.
- Implement eco-friendly materials and processes, with a focus on lifecycle and recycling.
- Target initial deployment for urban commuters, delivery services, and fleet operators.
- Exclusions: Traditional combustion engine vehicles, non-renewable energy systems.
