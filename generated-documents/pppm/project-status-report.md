# Project Status Report

## Project Overview
The Self Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) project aims to deliver a prototype electric vehicle that autonomously charges using solar and renewable energy, advanced battery management, and AI optimization. The project supports the strategic goal of enabling vehicles to arrive home fully charged and interact bidirectionally with the grid. Current phase: Design and prototyping, targeting market awareness and pilot deployment by 2030.
