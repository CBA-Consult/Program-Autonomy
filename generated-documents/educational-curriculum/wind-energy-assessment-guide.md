   *Sample Answer: Capacity factor is the ratio of actual energy output to theoretical maximum output over a given period. It indicates how efficiently a wind turbine operates and is crucial for economic viability assessment.*

### Exam 1: Wind Energy Basics (100 points)

#### Section A: Conceptual Understanding (40 points)

1. **Wind Resource Assessment (20 points)**
   
   A wind measurement campaign collected the following data at a potential wind farm site:
