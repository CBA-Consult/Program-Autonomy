These acceptance criteria provide a framework.  Specific values (response times, throughput, thresholds, etc.) need to be defined based on detailed system requirements and performance goals.  The testing strategy should incorporate a mix of automated and manual testing to ensure comprehensive validation.  Furthermore,  the energy harvesting efficiency should be rigorously tested under diverse real-world conditions to validate the claims of "fully charged arrival."
