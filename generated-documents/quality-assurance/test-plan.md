# Test Plan: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**1. Test Plan Overview**

* **Document Purpose:** This document outlines the test strategy, approach, and execution plan for the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) project.  It serves as a guide for the testing team and stakeholders, ensuring consistent and thorough testing throughout the development lifecycle.

* **Scope:** This plan covers the testing of the SCEV's core functionality, including the self-charging system (solar panel integration, regenerative braking), battery management system (BMS), user interface (UI), and vehicle performance (handling, fuel efficiency).  It *does not* include testing of the TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) subsystem, which is addressed in a separate test plan.

* **Objectives:** To verify and validate that the SCEV meets all functional, performance, security, and usability requirements specified in the project documentation.  To identify and report defects early in the development process, minimizing the risk of releasing a faulty product.  To achieve a software defect density of less than 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code and achieve 95% test coverage for critical functionalities.

* **Project Background:** The SCEV project aims to develop a self-charging electric vehicle that utilizes solar energy and regenerative braking to maximize range and minimize reliance on traditional charging infrastructure.

* **Test Plan Assumptions:**
    * Requirements documentation is complete and accurate.
    * Necessary test environments (hardware and software) will be available on time.
    * Sufficient test data will be available.
    * The development team will provide timely bug fixes.
    * Communication channels between the testing and development teams are effective.

* **Constraints:**
    * Limited testing time due to project deadlines.
    * Budget limitations may restrict the scope of automated testing.
    * Access to certain testing facilities may be limited.


**2. Test Items and Features**

* **Test Items:**  Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) software and hardware.  Specific modules include:
    * Self-Charging System (Solar Panel Integration, Regenerative Braking)
    * Battery Management System (BMS)
    * User Interface (UI) â€“ Dashboard display, mobile app integration
    * Vehicle Performance (Acceleration, Braking, Handling, Range)
    * Power Consumption and Distribution (Bidirectional Grid Interaction)

* **Version Identification:**  Software Version 1.0.0 (Initial Release); Hardware Revision A (Initial Build).  Specific build numbers will be updated as needed.

* **Dependencies:**  The testing process depends on the availability of the SCEV software and hardware builds, as well as the adpa-enterprise-framework-automation tools (as specified in the project metadata).

* **Integration Points:** The self-charging system integrates with the BMS, the UI, and the vehicle's powertrain.  The UI integrates with the vehicle's onboard systems and potentially external mobile applications.


**3. Test Approach and Strategy**

* **Testing Levels:**
    * **Unit Testing:** Developers will perform unit testing of individual modules.
    * **Integration Testing:**  Testing of the interaction between different modules (e.g., self-charging system and BMS).
    * **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete SCEV system.
    * **Acceptance Testing:** User acceptance testing (UAT) performed by representatives of the target customer groups.

* **Testing Types:**
    * **Functional Testing:** Verification of all specified functionalities.
    * **Performance Testing:** Evaluation of system responsiveness, scalability, and resource utilization under various load conditions. This will include load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing.
    * **Security Testing:** Assessment of the system's vulnerability to security threats.  This includes penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
    * **Usability Testing:** Evaluation of the user interface's ease of use and intuitiveness.
    * **Regression Testing:**  Retesting after bug fixes or changes to ensure that new issues haven't been introduced.

* **Test Design Techniques:**
    * Equivalence Partitioning
    * Boundary Value Analysis
    * Use Case Testing
    * State Transition Testing
    * Exploratory Testing

* **Automation Strategy:**  Automated tests will be implemented using the adpa-enterprise-framework-automation tools, focusing on regression testing and performance testing.  The goal is to automate at least 70% of regression tests.


**4. Test Environment Requirements**

* **Hardware:**  Test vehicles (SCEV prototypes), charging stations, solar simulators, data acquisition systems, network infrastructure. Specific hardware specifications will be documented separately.

* **Software:**  Test management tool (e.g., Jira, TestRail), automation framework (adpa-enterprise-framework-automation), database software, simulation tools.

* **Test Data:**  Realistic test data reflecting various driving conditions, environmental factors, and user behaviors will be generated and managed using a dedicated test data management system.

* **Environment Setup:** Detailed environment setup procedures will be created and documented, including network configurations, software installations, and test data population.

* **Access Requirements:**  Access to test environments will be controlled and documented, with appropriate security measures in place.
