## Test Cases Documentation: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Project

**1. Test Case Overview**

* **Purpose:** To verify the functionality, usability, performance, security, and overall quality of the SCEV system, including its self-charging mechanism, user interface, and integration with other systems.  This document focuses on testing aspects directly related to the provided project context, which heavily emphasizes the business strategy and core values rather than concrete software features.  Therefore, test cases will focus on validating the alignment of the system with the defined business goals.

* **Scope:**  This document outlines test cases focusing on the alignment of the SCEV project with its stated vision, mission, purpose, and core values.  It does not cover detailed software testing (UI, API, etc.) as the provided context lacks specific software requirements.  Future test cases will need to be developed once software specifications are finalized.

* **Test Case Naming Conventions:**  `TC_[Category]_[Number]_[Description]`  (e.g., `TC_Functional_001_Verify_Mission_Alignment`)

* **Test Case Categories and Priorities:**
    * **Functional:** High Priority - Verifying alignment with the business plan.
    * **UI (Future):** Medium Priority (To be defined after UI design is finalized).
    * **Integration (Future):** Medium Priority (To be defined after integration points are specified).
    * **Performance (Future):** Low Priority (To be defined after performance requirements are specified).
    * **Security (Future):** High Priority (To be defined after security requirements are specified).
    * **Negative (Future):** Medium Priority (To be defined after specific negative test scenarios are identified).
    * **Regression (Future):** High Priority (To be defined after initial testing and bug fixes).

* **Traceability to Requirements:**  Test cases will be linked to the Vision Statement, Mission Statement, Purpose Statement, and the defined Core Values within the project README.

**7. Negative Test Cases (Future)**

*To be defined after specific negative test scenarios are identified.*

**8. Regression Test Cases (Future)**

*To be defined after initial testing and bug fixes.*


**9. Test Data Requirements**

* The primary test data will consist of the project README itself, and any available design documents, long-term plans, or development rationale documents.  These documents will be used to verify the alignment of the SCEV project with its stated goals and core values.
* Data setup involves accessing and reviewing these documents.  Cleanup involves documenting the findings and their alignment with the requirements.
* Data privacy and security are not applicable in this context since the data is publicly available within the provided project README.


**10. Test Case Execution Guidelines**

* **Execution Order:** Functional tests should be executed first to establish a baseline of alignment with the business plan.  UI, integration, performance, security, and negative tests will follow based on availability of the relevant components.
* **Environment Prerequisites:**  Access to the project README and any related documentation.
* **Test Result Documentation:**  A test report should be created, documenting the pass/fail status of each test case, including screenshots or excerpts from relevant documents as evidence.  Any discrepancies between the SCEV project and its defined goals should be clearly documented as defects.
* **Defect Reporting Procedures:**  Defects should be reported using a standard bug tracking system, clearly outlining the test case ID, the observed behavior, the expected behavior, and the severity of the issue.  The report should include links or references to the relevant sections of the project README.


This document provides a framework for testing the SCEV project based on the available information.  Further test cases will need to be developed as more detailed requirements and specifications become available.
