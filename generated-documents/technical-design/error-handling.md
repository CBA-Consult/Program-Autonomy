## Error Handling Guidelines: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Project

These guidelines outline the error handling strategy for the SCEV project, encompassing all software and hardware components.  The goal is to ensure system reliability, facilitate efficient debugging, and provide a positive user experience.

**1. Error Handling Strategy:**

Our error handling strategy is built on the principles of **fail-fast, fail-safe, and graceful degradation**.  We will prioritize detecting errors as early as possible, preventing them from cascading into larger failures. When failures do occur, the system should enter a safe state, minimizing harm to the vehicle and its occupants.  Finally, the system should degrade gracefully, maintaining essential functionalities while limiting the impact of partial failures.

**2. Error Categories:**

Errors are categorized for better analysis and handling:

* **Critical Errors:**  These halt the operation of a critical system component (e.g., complete failure of the self-charging system, brake failure due to software error).  They require immediate attention and potentially a system shutdown to ensure safety.
* **Major Errors:** These significantly impact system functionality but do not pose an immediate safety risk (e.g., loss of connectivity to the smart grid, failure of a non-critical sensor).  They require prompt resolution and may trigger fallback mechanisms.
* **Minor Errors:** These have minimal impact on system functionality (e.g., minor UI glitches, temporary network interruptions).  They are logged for analysis and may be addressed in future releases.
* **User Errors:** These result from incorrect user input or actions (e.g., incorrect password entry, attempting to perform an invalid operation).  These require clear, user-friendly error messages.
* **Hardware Errors:** These originate from hardware malfunctions (e.g., sensor failure, battery malfunction).  These trigger diagnostic procedures and may initiate a safe mode operation.

**3. Error Logging:**

* **Centralized Logging:** A centralized logging system will collect all errors from various components.  This allows for easier aggregation, analysis, and correlation of errors.
* **Structured Logging:**  Logs will follow a standardized format (e.g., JSON) including timestamps, severity level (critical, major, minor), error code, component name, detailed error message, stack trace (where applicable), and relevant contextual data (e.g., vehicle speed, battery level).
* **Log Levels:**  The system will utilize standard log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to filter and prioritize logs.
* **Retention Policy:**  Logs will be retained according to a defined policy, considering legal and regulatory requirements.  Older logs may be archived for long-term analysis.

**4. Error Reporting:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** The system will continuously monitor its own health and report critical and major errors in real-time to a remote monitoring system.
* **Automated Alerts:** Automated alerts will be generated for critical errors, notifying relevant personnel (e.g., via email, SMS).
* **Error Dashboards:**  Web-based dashboards will visualize error rates, trends, and other relevant metrics, allowing for proactive identification of potential problems.
* **Remote Diagnostics:**  The system will facilitate remote diagnostics, allowing technicians to access logs and perform troubleshooting remotely.

**5. Recovery Procedures:**

* **Critical Errors:**  Recovery procedures for critical errors will prioritize safety. This may involve a safe shutdown of the vehicle, activation of emergency brakes, or other safety measures.  Detailed procedures will be documented and tested.
* **Major Errors:**  Recovery procedures will aim to restore functionality or switch to a degraded mode of operation.  This may involve retry mechanisms, fallback systems, or manual intervention.
* **Minor Errors:**  Minor errors may self-correct or require a simple user action (e.g., refreshing the UI).

**6. Retry Mechanisms:**

* **Exponential Backoff:** Retry mechanisms will employ exponential backoff strategies for transient errors (e.g., network interruptions).  This avoids overwhelming the system with repeated requests.
* **Maximum Retry Attempts:** A maximum number of retry attempts will be defined to prevent indefinite retries.
* **Retry Conditions:**  Specific conditions will trigger retry attempts (e.g., network errors, temporary sensor failures).

**7. Circuit Breakers:**

Circuit breakers will be implemented to prevent cascading failures.  If a specific service consistently fails, the circuit breaker will temporarily stop requests to that service, allowing it time to recover before resuming normal operation.

**8. User Error Messages:**

* **Clear and Concise:** User error messages will be clear, concise, and easy to understand.  Technical jargon should be avoided.
* **Actionable Advice:**  Error messages should provide actionable advice on how to resolve the error.
* **Consistent Style:**  Error messages will follow a consistent style and format.
* **Severity Indication:**  The severity of the error (e.g., warning, error) should be clearly indicated.

**9. Monitoring and Alerts:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** The system will be continuously monitored for errors, performance degradation, and other anomalies.
* **Threshold-based Alerts:** Alerts will be triggered when predefined thresholds are exceeded (e.g., high error rate, low battery level).
* **Alert Escalation:** A clear escalation process will be defined for handling alerts, ensuring that critical issues are addressed promptly.

**10. Troubleshooting Guide:**

A comprehensive troubleshooting guide will document common errors, their causes, and resolution steps.  This guide will be accessible to both technicians and end-users.


**Error Handling Patterns:**

* **Exception Handling:**  Appropriate exception handling mechanisms (try-catch blocks) will be used to gracefully handle anticipated errors.
* **Defensive Programming:**  Code will be written defensively, anticipating potential errors and handling them proactively.
* **Fail-Fast:** Critical errors will immediately terminate the affected process or component to prevent further damage.
* **Fail-Safe:** The system will transition to a safe state in the event of a failure, minimizing harm to the vehicle and occupants.


**Logging Standards:**

* **Timestamp:**  ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2024-10-27T10:30:00Z).
* **Severity:**  CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG.
* **Component:**  Name of the software or hardware component generating the log.
* **Message:**  Clear description of the error or event.
* **Context:**  Relevant data (e.g., sensor readings, user input).
* **Stack Trace:**  For software errors, a full stack trace will be included.


**User Experience Considerations:**

* **Informative Error Messages:**  Avoid technical jargon.  Provide clear instructions on how to fix user errors.
* **Visual Cues:** Use visual cues (e.g., color-coding) to indicate the severity of errors.
* **Progressive Disclosure:**  Only display relevant error information to the user; avoid overwhelming them with technical details.

**Monitoring and Alerting:**

* **Real-time Dashboards:**  Provide real-time monitoring of system health and error rates.
* **Automated Alerts:**  Send alerts to appropriate personnel for critical errors.
* **Alert Escalation:**  Define an escalation process to ensure timely resolution of critical issues.


**Recovery Procedures:**

* **Automatic Recovery:**  Implement automatic recovery mechanisms for transient errors (e.g., network interruptions).
* **Manual Recovery:**  Provide clear instructions for manual recovery procedures for more complex errors.
* **Rollback Mechanisms:**  Implement rollback mechanisms to restore the system to a known good state if necessary.

This comprehensive approach to error handling will significantly improve the reliability and safety of the SCEV, providing a robust and user-friendly experience.  Regular reviews and updates to these guidelines will be essential to adapt to evolving needs and technological advancements.
