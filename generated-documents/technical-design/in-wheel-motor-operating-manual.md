## 2. Getting Started {#getting-started}

### 2.1 First Time Setup

#### Before Your First Drive
1. **Read this manual completely**
2. **Familiarize yourself with the dashboard**
3. **Understand the driving modes**
4. **Practice in a safe area**

#### Initial System Check
When you first start your vehicle:
1. **Turn on the vehicle** using the start button
2. **Wait for the system check** (about 10 seconds)
3. **Look for the green "READY" indicator**
4. **Check that no warning lights are displayed**

### 2.2 Understanding the System Status

#### Dashboard Indicators
| Indicator | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 **READY** | System ready to drive | Normal operation |
| 🟡 **REGEN** | Regenerative braking active | Energy being recovered |
| 🔵 **ECO** | Eco mode active | Maximum efficiency |
| 🟠 **SPORT** | Sport mode active | Performance mode |
| 🔴 **WARNING** | System issue detected | Check manual or contact support |

#### Energy Flow Display
Your dashboard shows real-time energy flow:
- **Green arrows flowing to battery:** Energy being recovered
- **Blue arrows from battery:** Energy being used
- **Numbers:** Power levels in kilowatts (kW)

### 2.3 Pre-Drive Checklist

Before each drive, quickly check:

- [ ] Tire pressure (affects efficiency and safety)
- [ ] No warning lights on dashboard
- [ ] Mirrors and seat properly adjusted
- [ ] Climate control set to desired temperature

## 3. Understanding Regenerative Braking {#understanding-regenerative-braking}

### 3.1 How It Works

Think of regenerative braking as "reverse acceleration." When you slow down:

1. **You lift off the accelerator or press the brake**
2. **The in-wheel motors become generators**
3. **Your vehicle's motion creates electricity**
4. **This electricity charges your battery**
5. **You get more range for your next trip**

### 3.2 When Regeneration Happens

**Automatic Regeneration:**
- When you lift your foot off the accelerator
- During light to moderate braking
- When going downhill
- When cruise control reduces speed

**No Regeneration When:**
- Battery is fully charged (>95%)
- Vehicle speed is very low (<5 km/h)
- System temperature is too high
- Emergency braking is required

### 3.3 What You'll Feel

**Normal Regeneration:**
- Gentle slowing when you lift off the accelerator
- Smooth, progressive braking feel
- Slight vibration through the steering wheel (normal)

**Strong Regeneration:**
- More noticeable slowing effect
- Feeling similar to engine braking
- May feel different from traditional brakes initially

### 3.4 Regeneration Efficiency

Your system recovers different amounts of energy depending on conditions:

| Driving Condition | Energy Recovery |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| City stop-and-go | 25-30% |
| Highway cruising | 10-15% |
| Mountain driving | 30-40% |
| Gentle braking | 20-25% |

## 4. Daily Operation {#daily-operation}

### 4.1 Starting Your Drive

#### Step-by-Step Startup
1. **Enter the vehicle** and adjust your seat and mirrors
2. **Press the brake pedal** and push the start button
3. **Wait for the "READY" indicator** (green light)
4. **Select your driving mode** (Eco, Normal, Sport, or Custom)
5. **Release the parking brake**
6. **Gently press the accelerator** to begin driving

#### First Few Minutes
- The system may take 1-2 minutes to reach optimal efficiency
- Regeneration may be limited until components warm up
- Drive gently until the system is fully ready

### 4.2 Normal Driving Techniques

#### Accelerating
- **Smooth acceleration** is most efficient
- **Avoid rapid acceleration** unless necessary
- **Use cruise control** on highways when possible
- **Anticipate traffic** to maximize regeneration opportunities

#### Braking and Slowing
- **Lift off the accelerator early** to maximize regeneration
- **Brake gently** to stay in regenerative mode
- **Plan ahead** for stops and slowdowns
- **Use one-pedal driving** when comfortable

#### One-Pedal Driving
Many drivers enjoy "one-pedal driving":
- **Accelerate:** Press the accelerator pedal
- **Coast:** Partially lift off the accelerator
- **Slow down:** Lift off the accelerator completely
- **Stop:** Lift off completely and let regeneration slow you down
- **Emergency stop:** Use the brake pedal as normal

### 4.3 Parking and Shutdown

#### Parking Procedure
1. **Come to a complete stop**
2. **Engage the parking brake**
3. **Shift to Park (P)**
4. **Press the start button** to turn off the vehicle
5. **Wait for the system shutdown** (about 5 seconds)

#### After Parking
- The system may continue running cooling fans for a few minutes
- This is normal and helps protect components
- The vehicle will automatically shut down completely

## 9. Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### 9.1 Common Issues and Solutions

#### Reduced Regeneration
**Symptoms:**
- Lower energy recovery than usual
- Regeneration meter shows reduced levels
- Range not extending as expected

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
- **Battery fully charged:** Normal behavior, regeneration resumes as battery depletes
- **Cold weather:** Allow system to warm up, regeneration will improve
- **High system temperature:** Allow cooling, avoid aggressive driving temporarily
- **Software needs update:** Check for and install available updates

#### Unusual Noises
**Symptoms:**
- Grinding, whining, or clicking sounds
- Noises that change with speed or regeneration

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
- **Normal regeneration sounds:** Slight humming or whirring is normal
- **Tire noise:** Check tire condition and pressure
- **Brake noise:** May indicate need for brake service
- **Motor noise:** Contact service if noise is loud or concerning

#### Dashboard Warnings
**Symptoms:**
- Warning lights or messages on dashboard
- Reduced performance or efficiency

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Note the specific warning** and any associated messages
2. **Check this manual** for warning explanations
3. **Contact service** if warning is red or flashing
4. **Drive cautiously** if safe to continue

### 9.2 Emergency Procedures

#### Loss of Regeneration
**If regeneration stops working:**
1. **Continue driving normally** - regular brakes still work
2. **Monitor battery level** - may drain faster without regeneration
3. **Plan charging stops** - reduce range estimates
4. **Contact service** - schedule inspection as soon as possible

#### System Overheating
**If you see temperature warnings:**
1. **Reduce speed** and avoid aggressive driving
2. **Turn off air conditioning** temporarily if needed
3. **Find safe place to stop** if warning persists
4. **Allow system to cool** before continuing
5. **Contact service** if problem continues

#### Complete System Failure
**If the regeneration system fails completely:**
1. **Vehicle will still drive** - motors provide propulsion
2. **Brakes still work** - conventional braking system remains functional
3. **Range will be reduced** - plan charging accordingly
4. **Contact service immediately** - system needs professional attention
