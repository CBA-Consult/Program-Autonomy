## System Design Specification: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**Document Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** October 26, 2024


**1. System Purpose and Scope:**

The purpose of this system is to design and implement a self-charging electric vehicle (SCEV) that utilizes renewable energy sources to maintain a full charge, minimizing reliance on external charging infrastructure.  The system's scope encompasses the design and integration of the self-charging mechanism, energy management system, user interface, and necessary vehicle modifications.  This specification focuses on the core self-charging system, excluding aspects like vehicle chassis design, motor control, and other standard EV components.

**2. System Architecture:**

The SCEV system architecture comprises three major subsystems:

* **Energy Harvesting Subsystem:** This subsystem is responsible for capturing renewable energy.  The primary energy source is currently envisioned as solar panels integrated into the vehicle body, but future iterations may incorporate regenerative braking and potentially other sources.

* **Energy Management Subsystem:** This subsystem manages the flow and storage of harvested and battery energy. It optimizes energy distribution to various vehicle systems, prioritizing critical functions and maximizing the vehicle's range.  It includes a Battery Management System (BMS) and a Power Management Unit (PMU).

* **User Interface Subsystem:** This subsystem provides the driver with information about the self-charging system's status, energy levels, and operational parameters.  This may involve a dedicated display screen and integration with the vehicle's infotainment system.

**3. Module Descriptions:**

* **Solar Panel Array Module:**  Collects solar energy and converts it to DC electricity.  Includes array optimization algorithms for maximizing power output in varying sunlight conditions.

* **Optimized In-Wheel Motor Module:**  Advanced permanent magnet synchronous motors with dual-rotor configuration for enhanced regenerative braking. Captures kinetic energy during braking and converts it to electricity with 95%+ efficiency. Features frictionless electromagnetic induction for continuous energy harvesting during normal driving operations.

* **Power Management Unit (PMU):**  Manages the power flow between the energy harvesting modules, the battery, and the vehicle's electrical systems.  Includes MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) algorithms.

* **Battery Management System (BMS):**  Monitors and controls the state of the vehicle's battery, ensuring optimal charging and discharging.  Includes cell balancing, state-of-charge estimation, and safety mechanisms.

* **Energy Storage Module:** The vehicle's battery pack.  Specifications will depend on vehicle size and performance requirements.

* **User Interface Module:** Provides real-time feedback on energy generation, storage, and consumption.  Includes visualizations of energy flow and battery status.  Communicates with the PMU and BMS.

* **Pendulum Energy Harvester Module (Research & Development):**  This module, currently under research, aims to supplement the solar energy harvesting via kinetic energy from wheel rotation using a pendulum mechanism. (Details in Section 6)

**6. Processing Logic:**

* **Energy Harvesting Subsystem:**  The solar panel array module continuously monitors sunlight intensity and adjusts its operation to maximize power output.  The PMU aggregates power from all harvesting sources.

* **Energy Management Subsystem:** The PMU distributes power based on prioritized needs of vehicle systems (e.g., critical functions first).  The BMS manages battery charging and discharging to maintain optimal performance and safety.

* **Pendulum Energy Harvester Module (R&D):**  This module uses a pendulum suspended within the wheel to generate electricity via electromagnetic induction as the wheel rotates. The pendulum's weight and length are critical parameters, requiring optimization (detailed below).  A mathematical model is required to predict power output based on these parameters, wheel speed, and damping factors.  Optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms) will be used to determine the optimal pendulum weight and length.

* **Over-current Protection:**  Fuses and circuit breakers will be used to protect against excessive current draw.

* **Over-temperature Protection:**  The BMS will monitor battery temperature and implement cooling mechanisms or shut down charging if necessary.

* **Fault Detection and Reporting:**  The system will monitor for errors and report them to the driver via the user interface.

* **Safety Shut-off:**  In case of critical errors, the system will automatically shut down to prevent damage or injury.
