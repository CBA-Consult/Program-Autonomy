## System Design Specification: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**Document Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** October 26, 2024


**1. System Purpose and Scope:**

The purpose of this system is to design and implement a self-charging electric vehicle (SCEV) that utilizes renewable energy sources to maintain a full charge, minimizing reliance on external charging infrastructure.  The system's scope encompasses the design and integration of the self-charging mechanism, energy management system, user interface, and necessary vehicle modifications.  This specification focuses on the core self-charging system, excluding aspects like vehicle chassis design, motor control, and other standard EV components.

**2. System Architecture:**

The SCEV system architecture comprises three major subsystems:

* **Energy Harvesting Subsystem:** This subsystem is responsible for capturing renewable energy.  The primary energy source is currently envisioned as solar panels integrated into the vehicle body, but future iterations may incorporate regenerative braking and potentially other sources.

* **Energy Management Subsystem:** This subsystem manages the flow and storage of harvested and battery energy. It optimizes energy distribution to various vehicle systems, prioritizing critical functions and maximizing the vehicle's range.  It includes a Battery Management System (BMS) and a Power Management Unit (PMU).

* **User Interface Subsystem:** This subsystem provides the driver with information about the self-charging system's status, energy levels, and operational parameters.  This may involve a dedicated display screen and integration with the vehicle's infotainment system.

**3. Module Descriptions:**

* **Solar Panel Array Module:**  Collects solar energy and converts it to DC electricity.  Includes array optimization algorithms for maximizing power output in varying sunlight conditions.

* **Regenerative Braking Module (Future):**  Captures kinetic energy during braking and converts it to electricity. (Not implemented in initial version)

* **Power Management Unit (PMU):**  Manages the power flow between the energy harvesting modules, the battery, and the vehicle's electrical systems.  Includes MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) algorithms.

* **Battery Management System (BMS):**  Monitors and controls the state of the vehicle's battery, ensuring optimal charging and discharging.  Includes cell balancing, state-of-charge estimation, and safety mechanisms.

* **Energy Storage Module:** The vehicle's battery pack.  Specifications will depend on vehicle size and performance requirements.

* **User Interface Module:** Provides real-time feedback on energy generation, storage, and consumption.  Includes visualizations of energy flow and battery status.  Communicates with the PMU and BMS.

* **In Wheel Frictionless Maglev Energy Harvester Module (Research & Development):**  This module, currently under research, aims to supplement the solar energy harvesting via kinetic energy from wheel rotation using magnetic levitation technology to eliminate friction and drag.

* **Energy Management Subsystem:** The PMU distributes power based on prioritized needs of vehicle systems (e.g., critical functions first).  The BMS manages battery charging and discharging to maintain optimal performance and safety.

* **In Wheel Frictionless Maglev Energy Harvester Module (R&D):**  This module uses magnetic levitation technology to suspend rotating energy generation components within the wheel, eliminating mechanical friction and drag. The system employs superconducting magnets or permanent magnet arrays to create a frictionless rotating environment. Key parameters include magnetic field strength, levitation gap, rotor mass, and electromagnetic induction coil configuration. Advanced control algorithms maintain stable levitation while optimizing energy generation efficiency. The frictionless operation significantly reduces energy losses and improves overall system efficiency compared to traditional mechanical approaches.t and length.
