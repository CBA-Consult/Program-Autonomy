# Security Design Document: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**Project Name:** SCEV - Self-Charging Electric Vehicle

**Document Version:** 1.0

**Date:** October 26, 2024


## 1. Security Overview

This document outlines the security design for the SCEV, focusing on protecting vehicle data, user privacy, and the integrity of the self-charging system.  The SCEV incorporates several interconnected systems: the vehicle's onboard systems (including the self-charging mechanism, battery management system, and TPMS), cloud-based services for data analytics and remote diagnostics, and mobile applications for user interaction.  Security must be integrated at every level.  Our approach adheres to a defense-in-depth strategy, employing multiple layers of security controls to mitigate risks.

**Security Goals:**

* **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive vehicle data (e.g., location, battery status, user profiles) from unauthorized access.
* **Integrity:** Ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of vehicle data and system operations.  Prevent unauthorized modification or tampering.
* **Availability:** Maintain the availability of vehicle functions and services, preventing denial-of-service attacks or system failures.
* **Authentication:** Verify the identity of users and devices accessing the system.
* **Authorization:** Control access to vehicle functions and data based on user roles and permissions.


## 2. Authentication Design

**User Authentication:**

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Users will authenticate using a combination of methods, such as a password, biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition), and a one-time password (OTP) generated by a mobile app.  This mitigates risks associated with stolen or compromised passwords.
* **Password Management:**  Strong password policies will be enforced, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes.  Password complexity will be enforced.
* **Account Lockout:**  After multiple failed login attempts, the user account will be temporarily locked to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Device Authentication:**

* **Secure Boot:**  The vehicle's onboard systems will use secure boot to ensure that only authorized software is loaded during startup, preventing unauthorized code execution.
* **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):**  Sensitive cryptographic keys and secrets will be stored in tamper-resistant HSMs to protect against physical attacks.
* **Certificate-Based Authentication:**  Communication between the vehicle and cloud services will be secured using digital certificates and mutual authentication.


## 3. Authorization Framework

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Access to vehicle functions and data will be controlled using RBAC.  Users will be assigned roles (e.g., owner, driver, service technician) with specific permissions.

**Least Privilege:**  Users will only be granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

**Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  ACLs will be used to define access permissions for specific data and system resources.

**Data Segmentation:**  Sensitive data will be segmented and isolated to limit the impact of potential breaches.


## 4. Data Protection

**Data Encryption:**

* **In-Transit Encryption:**  All communication between the vehicle, mobile app, and cloud services will be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or a higher standard.
* **At-Rest Encryption:**  Sensitive data stored on the vehicle and in the cloud will be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
* **Data Masking and Anonymization:**  For non-critical data, data masking and anonymization techniques will be used to protect privacy.

**Data Minimization:**  The SCEV will only collect and store the minimum necessary data to provide its functions.

**Data Retention Policy:**  A clear data retention policy will be defined to specify how long data is stored and when it is deleted.

**Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations:**  The SCEV will comply with relevant data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, and others.


## 5. Network Security

**Secure Communication Channels:**  All communication between vehicle systems, cloud services, and mobile apps will use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, MQTT over TLS).

**Firewall:**  A firewall will be implemented on the vehicle and cloud infrastructure to control network traffic and prevent unauthorized access.

**Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  IDS/IPS will be deployed to monitor network traffic for malicious activity and prevent attacks.

**Network Segmentation:**  The vehicle's network will be segmented to isolate critical systems from less critical ones, limiting the impact of potential breaches.

**Wireless Security:**  If wireless communication is used for the self-charging system, it will be secured using strong encryption protocols (e.g., WPA3).


## 6. Security Controls

**Secure Coding Practices:**  Secure coding standards will be enforced throughout the development lifecycle to minimize vulnerabilities.

**Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerability Scanning:**  Automated vulnerability scanning tools will be used to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

**Penetration Testing:**  Penetration testing will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls.

**Security Awareness Training:**  Employees will receive regular security awareness training to educate them about security threats and best practices.


## 7. Threat Modeling

A threat modeling exercise will be conducted to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.  This will involve analyzing the SCEV's architecture and identifying potential attack vectors.  The results will inform the design and implementation of security controls.  We will use a combination of threat modeling methodologies, including STRIDE and PASTA.  Specific threats will include:

* **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive vehicle data.
* **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:**  Disruption of vehicle functions or services.
* **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks:**  Interception of communication between the vehicle and other systems.
* **Software vulnerabilities:**  Exploitation of software flaws to gain unauthorized access or control.
* **Physical attacks:**  Tampering with vehicle hardware to gain unauthorized access.
* **Supply chain attacks:**  Compromise of components or software during the manufacturing process.


## 8. Security Testing Strategy

A comprehensive security testing strategy will be implemented, including:

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Analysis of source code to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Testing of the running application to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**  Identifying and managing vulnerabilities in third-party components.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Simulating real-world attacks to assess the effectiveness of security controls.
* **Fuzz Testing:**  Providing invalid or unexpected inputs to identify vulnerabilities.


## 9. Incident Response Plan

An incident response plan will be developed to guide the company's response to security incidents.  This plan will include procedures for detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activity.  The plan will define roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and escalation procedures.


## 10. Compliance Requirements

The SCEV will comply with all relevant security and privacy regulations, including:

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**  For data protection in the European Union.
* **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):**  For data protection in California.
* **ISO 27001:**  For information security management systems.
* **Automotive cybersecurity standards (e.g., ISO/SAE 21434):**  Specific automotive cybersecurity requirements.
* **Relevant national and regional regulations:**  Other applicable regulations.


## Security Monitoring

Continuous security monitoring will be implemented to detect and respond to security threats.  This will involve:

* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Centralized logging and analysis of security events.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Real-time monitoring of network traffic for malicious activity.
* **Vulnerability Management:**  Regular scanning and patching of vulnerabilities.
* **Security Auditing:**  Regular review of security logs and system configurations.
* **Compliance Monitoring:**  Regular audits to ensure compliance with relevant regulations.


This document provides a high-level overview of the security design for the SCEV.  Further details will be provided in subsequent design specifications.  This document will be updated as the project progresses and new information becomes available.
