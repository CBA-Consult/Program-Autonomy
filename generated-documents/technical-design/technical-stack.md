## Technical Stack Overview: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Project

This document outlines the technical stack for the SCEV project, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and future-proofing.  Version 1.0.0

**1. Technology Stack Overview:**

The SCEV project requires a robust and flexible technology stack capable of handling complex simulations, data analysis, and potentially real-time data ingestion from vehicles.  We will leverage a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.  The stack will support both the business planning aspects (website, data analysis) and the embedded systems within the vehicle (energy harvesting optimization).

**2. Frontend Technologies:**

* **Technology:** React.js with TypeScript
* **Justification:** React provides a component-based architecture, facilitating code reusability and maintainability. TypeScript adds static typing, improving code quality and reducing runtime errors.  It's a popular and well-supported framework with a large community.
* **Version:** React 18, TypeScript 5
* **Dependencies:**  Material-UI (for UI components), Axios (for API calls), Chart.js (for data visualization)

**3. Backend Technologies:**

* **Technology:** Node.js with Express.js and NestJS (microservices)
* **Justification:** Node.js provides a JavaScript runtime environment, allowing for consistent development across frontend and backend. Express.js simplifies API development. NestJS is chosen for building scalable and maintainable microservices, offering a structured approach with dependency injection and modularity.
* **Version:** Node.js 20, Express.js 4, NestJS 10
* **Dependencies:**  Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction),  Passport.js (for authentication), various utility libraries as needed for specific microservices.

**4. Database Technologies:**

* **Technology:** MongoDB (NoSQL) and PostgreSQL (Relational)
* **Justification:** MongoDB is ideal for handling flexible, semi-structured data such as sensor readings and simulation results. PostgreSQL is used for structured data like business planning documents, financial data, and user accounts requiring ACID properties. This combination provides flexibility and robustness.
* **Version:** MongoDB 6, PostgreSQL 15

**5. Infrastructure Components:**

* **Cloud Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* **Justification:**  Both AWS and GCP offer scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure, including compute, storage, and database services. The choice will depend on existing company infrastructure and specific pricing considerations.
* **Services:**  EC2 (virtual machines), S3 (object storage), RDS (managed databases), Lambda (serverless functions), API Gateway, ECS (container orchestration) or Kubernetes.

**6. Development Tools:**

* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* **Version Control:** Git (using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
* **Project Management:** Jira or similar
* **Other Tools:**  Docker (for containerization), npm (for Node.js package management), yarn (alternative package manager).

**7. Testing Tools:**

* **Unit Testing:** Jest, Mocha, Chai
* **Integration Testing:** Supertest, Cypress
* **End-to-End Testing:** Selenium, Cypress
* **Justification:** A comprehensive testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of the software.  This combination of testing frameworks covers various levels of testing, from unit to end-to-end.

**8. Monitoring Tools:**

* **Technology:** Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog (or similar)
* **Justification:**  These tools provide comprehensive monitoring of the application's performance, including metrics, logs, and traces.  This allows for proactive identification and resolution of issues.

**9. Deployment Tools:**

* **Technology:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Run, or Kubernetes
* **Justification:** These tools simplify the deployment process, allowing for automated deployments and rollbacks.  The choice will depend on the chosen cloud provider and infrastructure setup.

**10. Version Control and CI/CD:**

* **Version Control:** Git (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
* **CI/CD:**  GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
* **Justification:**  A robust CI/CD pipeline is essential for automating the build, testing, and deployment processes.  This ensures fast and reliable releases and allows for continuous integration and continuous delivery.


**Embedded System (Energy Harvesting Optimization):**

* **Microcontroller:**  A high-performance microcontroller (e.g., STM32H7, ESP32-S3) with sufficient processing power and peripherals for sensor data acquisition, signal processing, and communication.
* **Sensors:**  Accelerometer, gyroscope, potentially other sensors depending on the design.
* **Energy Harvesting Component:**  Pendulum-based electromagnetic generator.
* **Programming Language:** C/C++ (for efficiency and real-time capabilities)
* **Development Tools:**  Embedded IDE (e.g., Keil MDK, IAR Embedded Workbench), JTAG debugger.


**Dependencies:**

* `adpa-enterprise-framework-automation`: This dependency (assuming it's an internal library) needs further clarification to understand its role and how it integrates with the overall stack.  It may provide common utilities or automation scripts.


**Scalability Considerations:**

* Microservices architecture allows for independent scaling of individual components.
* Cloud infrastructure provides elasticity, allowing for scaling up or down based on demand.
* Database choices (MongoDB and PostgreSQL) are designed for scalability.


**Maintainability Considerations:**

* Microservices architecture promotes modularity and reduces dependencies.
* Use of TypeScript enhances code quality and readability.
* Comprehensive testing strategy ensures code stability.
* Version control and CI/CD streamline development and deployment processes.


This comprehensive technical stack provides a solid foundation for the SCEV project, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and a robust solution for both the business planning and embedded systems components.  Further details on specific libraries and configurations will be documented in subsequent design specifications.
