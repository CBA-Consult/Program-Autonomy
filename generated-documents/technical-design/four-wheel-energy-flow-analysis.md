|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **City Driving** | 15 kW | 3.5 kW × 2 = 7 kW | 2.5 kW × 2 = 5 kW | **12 kW** | **-3 kW** | **+80%** |
| **Highway Cruising** | 25 kW | 6.5 kW × 2 = 13 kW | 5.5 kW × 2 = 11 kW | **24 kW** | **-1 kW** | **+96%** |
| **Acceleration** | 150 kW | 2.5 kW × 2 = 5 kW | 1.5 kW × 2 = 3 kW | **8 kW** | **-142 kW** | **+5.3%** |
| **Deceleration** | -50 kW | 9 kW × 2 = 18 kW | 7 kW × 2 = 14 kW | **32 kW** | **+82 kW** | **+164%** |

## 3. Comprehensive System Efficiency Analysis

### 3.1 Weighted Average Efficiency

Based on typical driving patterns:
- **City Driving:** 40% of total driving time
- **Highway Cruising:** 35% of total driving time  
- **Acceleration:** 15% of total driving time
- **Deceleration:** 10% of total driving time

**Weighted Average Energy Recovery:**
```
Weighted Efficiency = (80% × 0.40) + (96% × 0.35) + (5.3% × 0.15) + (164% × 0.10)
                    = 32% + 33.6% + 0.8% + 16.4%
                    = 82.8% average energy recovery
```

### 3.2 Net Energy Independence Analysis

| Driving Scenario | Energy Independence Ratio | Self-Sufficiency Level |
|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
